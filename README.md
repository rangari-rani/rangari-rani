## 📂 Explore My Learning Journey

Along with production-style projects, I’ve also maintained academic repositories:

- 🎓 **[MCA Academic Projects](https://github.com/rangari-rani/academic-projects-mca)** – A mix of web, desktop, and algorithmic apps built during my Master’s at RTMNU, **Nagpur, India**
- 🎖️ **[CDAC Projects](https://github.com/rangari-rani/academic-projects-cdac)** – A curated set of full-stack web apps built during and after my PG-DAC journey at CDAC, **Nagpur, India**

These show how my foundations were built before diving into real-world full-stack work.
